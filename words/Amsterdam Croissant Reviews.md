After watching [Luis's Paris top 5 croissant reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp84sRpM1Js), my partner and I were inspired to make our own Amsterdam croissant reviews, so here we go!

Multiple choices of great croissants. Sesame was my favourite. Crunchy and fresh. Substantial, trully fills the mouth. Possibly a bit too buttery for some, but I loved it.

Overall mediocre. Felt kinda stale. Not cunchy at all. Slightly buttery.

Very crunchy, perhaps even a bit too much! Felt decently fresh even though I got them around 14:00 in the day. Not very buttery in flavour.

Substantial, multiple layers inside. Not that crunchy, and didn't taste very buttery. Felt slightly less than fresh, but we got them late in the day (around 13:00)

Jumbo

0.39€
More toasted on the outside than some of the other options. Mildly flaky. Not a lot of layers, not very fluffy. Fairly balanced flavor. The plate in the picture is smaller than the plate we used for the other pictures btw.

Crunchy, buttery, sweet & roasted flavor, juicy inside. Bigger than most of its competitors. A croissant with opinions.

Very airy, light and somewhat buttery. Decently flaky, though not crunchy. One of the few with a complete half-moon shape!

Multiple layers inside and outside, pretty big, relatively neutral flavor with slight butteriness, slightly stale but it was end of day.

Petite is the word that comes to mind. Light, flaky, and crunchy. A bit reminiscent of the AH and Jumbo light croissants. Feels a bit overpriced for the amount.

Smooth inside, crunchy and flaky outside. Didn’t feel too buttery for me. Definitely quite fresh. Long queues!
