#### Overall thoughts
I like sharp lines, and clear colors. I wouldn't want a fade, most of them suck. I have to consider my bike's thin tubes, and lack of clear dividing lines across them. I like matte styling. 

Perhaps something using white and orange as primary colours?

I need to pick the symbol that I want to go for?
