Ingredients
* 150G vegan butter
* 150G flour
* 1 cooking milk cream
* ~1L of water (warm)
* Salt
* Pepper

1. Start with medium heat to melt the butter. 
2. Increase the heat and put in the flour. You need it to be baked a bit before moving forward
3. Start putting the first 500ml of water, slowly
4. Mix a lot
5. Put in the milk cream
6. Put the rest of the water, which should be 400ml -X, where X is however much your milk cream was (in total you should put <1L of liquid). It's okay to put even less, if it looks like the mix is getting too watery
7. Put in the salt and pepper and mix them well
8. When it begins to bubble up, it should be good to go
9. Let it cool down for at least 10m. It will become thicker. Mix it occassionally so that the top doesn't get crusty

Other notes:
* While baking, do not go to a very high heat, as it may break apart the bechamel
