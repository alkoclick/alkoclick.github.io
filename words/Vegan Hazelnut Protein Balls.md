These create a result very similar to Ferrero Rocher balls.

Ingredients:
* 1 scoop (about 2 tbsp) chocolate flavoured protein powder (or cocoa)
* 1 cup (about 135g) hazelnuts, peeled + 28 hazelnuts
* 3 tbsp Maple syrup
* 3 tbsp water
* 0.5 tbsp vanilla extract (or similar flavouring like cinnamon)

Instructions:
1. Peel the hazelnuts ( I used the baking soda and cold water method)
2. Roast the hazelnuts for 15m at 180C
3. Separate 8 hazelnuts, blend them to small but not fine particles, we will use them for coating, set this aside
4. Pick out 20 hazelnuts, set them aside, we will use them for filling
5. In a blender, put the remaining roasted hazelnuts, the protein powder, and blend well together. Then pour in the maple syrup and water. It's better if you do this with 1 of each (syrup+water) at a time and blending in between but not necessary
6. Pick out a spoonful of the mixture, place a hazelnut in, then press and roll it into a ball. Then roll it through the crumble you created in step 3. Do this until you run out of mixture
7. Place the balls in a tupper and refrigerate or freeze them for at least 30m before consuming

That's it!
