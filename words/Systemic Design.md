There are many stories like it, but Theodore Sturgeon's 1941 story "Microcosmic God" goes a bit like this: A lone inventor named Kidder who enjoys creating things, is frustrated at humanity's slow innovation pace. He builds a generation of small creatures named "Neoterics" that create various inventions. A lot of things happen and eventually the Neoterics become more advanced than humanity and outlive their creator and god.

Kidder, like others, has designed a... ![[System]]
A more practical example is the German photographer [[Wolfgang Tillmans]], who in one of his phases controlled the photo development closely, to produce essentially random results, but through a highly specific process.

> Eventually he made sets of pictures that were entirely created by exposing photographic paper to various sources of light in a dark room, then also controlling and introducing various objects and agents in the chemical mix of the development process.

In one of my previous companies, [[Zivver]], the leadership team explicitly acknowledged that. Company comms shifted from "We are a company that makes secure communication products" to "We are a company that builds a team which can make secure communication products". The actual wording was probably a bit better and it's still kinda corporate-y, but the message is visible regardless - we're not building the product, the team is the product.

In Nordic Games Conference 2017 I watched a presentation about Systemic Design. They explained the reasoning and process behind the various systems in open world games which make the world feel more alive: Environment cycles, animal herds, player notoriety. These all help develop richer experiences for the player as they provide much more depth and replayability.
