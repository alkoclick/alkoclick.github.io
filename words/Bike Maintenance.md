I got really into bike maintenance during my burnout in the fall of 2025.

It all started with me doing some work on the bike that I got from the previous owner of my house: [Koga Miyata Road Champ 7005 2009](Koga%20Miyata%20Road%20Champ%207005%202009.md) (bottom bike in the above picture).

Riding that bike wasn't great for long distances because it's a bit undersized for me, but fixing it up was great fun! So I set out to find a bike that was my size and preferably also an older Koga Miyata (old because I like the style of pre-2000s steel racing bikes, Koga for the pride of my adopted homeland). Thus I picked up my [Koga Miyata Roadspeed 1999](Koga%20Miyata%20Roadspeed%201999.md) (top bike in the above picture).

After fixing this one I did actually get a bunch of kilos in, specifically around 300 in a couple months! I also picked up and refurbished a mountain bike for a good friend, this [Altec Arcus](Altec%20Arcus.md) (pictured here after a glow-up).

Another friend crashed his bike, got a cheap new one, and I got to work fixing it up: This [Altec Metro](Altec%20Metro.md) was not in great shape, but we patched it up to a good enough state for a city bike.

My latest ongoing project is this [Peugeot PH10S 1981](Peugeot%20PH10S%201981.md), which I'm looking to paint up in some [cool colors](Bike%20design%20ideas.md), something I haven't done yet! I'll post up some pics once done.
