Is there nothing great in this space?

I saw YunoHost first, and it looks kinda neat (for something written in Python and Bash), but it looks like it's an entire OS, and doesn't play nicely with being added on top of an existing install.

Then I saw Umbrel, which seems extremely techbro coded based on their opening screenshot of the homepage with "Good Evening Chad" prominently displayed. The expected array of crypto apps and nostr nodes feature in their app catalog, and their investor roll looks icky so, that's a hard pass.

CasaOs looks interesting, they seem to wrap dockerfiles and commands. However, they have no docs anywhere on the page, and the only link is to their Discord... which again doesn't bode well for future support.
