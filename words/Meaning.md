Lately I've been thinking about finding more meaningful experiences. But I don't even know what meaning is. 

What is meaning to me? Something to discover later

What are meaningful experiences?
* Educational
* Challenging
* Novel
* Thought provoking
* Feel good to share or recollect
* Sometimes time-sensitive, or difficult to repeat at a later stage

What are some examples of meaningful experiences?
* Visiting the [[Falles - Fallas]] in Valencia
* Spending holidays with family
* Reading Borges with my partner
* Read or write something profound

Meaningless experiences:
* Pass time
* may feel boring
* are well-known and predictable 
* have been done before numerous times


It feels like the previous experiences allow me to well, experience meaning. But how can I create meaning? Is that even doable? Or do I just have a bad framing?

[This essay](https://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/entry/23) about the color of bits makes a very interesting point: Objects have a colour, which is an untraceable property. E.g this ring beloged to my grandmother, it's not just an old ring. This colour property feels interestingly close to the meaning property of objects

Nearly 2 years after typing these thoughts for the first time, I put more energy into thinking about [[Enchanted Objects]], meaningful objects.
