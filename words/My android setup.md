I've been experimenting with an android setup using an external keyboard and termux as my driver. I do a lot of infrastructure work which basically boils down to editing yaml or HCL files with no need of compilation, and shell scripts are thankfully decently universal.

I'm currently using:
* Samsung Galaxy S8 tab (sometimes on Dex, sometimes not)
* My [ZSA Moonlander](alkoclick/words/ZSA%20Moonlander.md) (soon to be replaced by something wireless)
* Nreal Air glasses as an external screen (sometimes)
* Termux with zsh as my terminal of choice (you can find my config [here](https://codeberg.org/alkoclick/android-dotfiles))
