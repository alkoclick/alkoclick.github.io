There is a local myth about [[Zevgolatio]]'s clock tower. It goes a bit like this:

There was a local rich family, one of the two in Zevgolatio. The patriarch was a very rich man, but also very bad, and he made his money off of cheating people off their money and taking over their properties. When he grew old, he eventually fell very ill, and nothing seemed to aid him. He also stayed alive in bed for years in a horrible condition. Those who visited him spoke of the terrible stench and the horrible wounds developed in his flesh. When he finally died, they buried him in the family grave.

A few years later, another member of the family died, and they opened the family grave to bury her. That was when they realized that the body of the man hadn't decayed in the slightest and he was the same as the day they put him in the grave. People thought he was a vampire and he hadn't found peace. The family was told that they would need to do a great good to the community so that such an evil man would be forgiven and find peace. 

That was why they decided to build the clock tower, which strikes at every hour and every half hour mark. The tower's bell rings sorrowfully and not joyously, because it is a funeral bell.
