Yeah, it’s been quite a time.

In the chaos, some companies have definitely risen [above and beyond what was expected of them](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/03/05/covid-19-microsoft-hourly-workers/) (maybe we just had low standards?). Some found a good platform to [have some lighthearted fun](https://www.isitcanceledyet.com/). And some, have still not figured out [how to do generics](https://doesgohavegenericsyet.com/).

Where do you go from here (no pun intended)? Where do we go? Twitter (especially the entrepreneurial side) has been a mix of people giving reasonable advice and people trying to predict the next remote work unicorn.

Sigh. Yeah, I guess that’s a pretty normal Twitter week after all. Let’s take a look…

-   [_… If the government really can’t edit video to conceal faces, it had better explain why. Teenagers, the court says, have found a way to stick cat heads in front of faces, though “we do not necessarily advocate that specific technique._](https://twitter.com/bradheath/status/1237388147337510914)_”_
-   Okay that last one was the best sentence the court has ever said, period. I’m gonna give you some time to process it. It’s okay, take your time.
-   Take your time
-   Are you sure you clicked that link before proceeding?
-   Just asking yo, but please make sure you did. A’ight, peace
-   The [Oracle vs Google](https://twitter.com/shipilev/status/1237639742684102656) fight for the future of APIs continues to rage. We’ve covered this previously as well, but in short, Google reimplemented a bunch of Java APIs for Android, Oracle (Java’s owner) sued them for it and there’s a raging legal fight now arriving to the Supreme Court (!) about copyrighting interfaces
-   [Dark Lang](https://medium.com/@wilk/dark-lang-an-uncommon-step-towards-the-future-of-programming-921cf7f38baf) appears promising, I’d like to test it out at some point
-   After killing a biker, Uber’s [Christines](https://www.google.com/search?q=john+carpenter+car+movie&oq=john+carpenter+car+movie) are [back for blood](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21172213/uber-self-driving-car-resume-testing-san-francisco-crash) in the streets of San Fransisco
-   [Slice your tasks vertically folks](https://twitter.com/mariopiogioiosa/status/1236195254581301248)
-   There is no I in team, but [could there be documentation without u](https://twitter.com/rauschma/status/1235980161939619840)?
-   [We were so preoccupied with thinking if we could](https://twitter.com/MaartjeME/status/1236697317421580289)…
-   Quote from guy in VPN malware who sold millions of users’ data : [“When you consider the relationship between these types of apps and an analytics company, it makes a lot of sense — especially considering our history as a startup.”](https://gizmodo.com/at-least-20-vpn-and-ad-blocking-apps-with-35-million-do-1842228757) (no, Medium does not have a puke emoji sadly)
-   Oh yeah and [your weekly tech drama thing](https://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/22350/the-young-turks-union-cenk-uygur-labor-organizing)

In other interesting news, I was recently in a room, listening to some people deliver feedback of a conference. Apparently a sub-theme across keynotes had been diversity in the field which most attendees praised highly! There were a few who complained that it wasn’t technical, which is an opinion I am not going to comment on or judge, after rewriting my judging comment a bunch of times. Then, a 50-something individual let us know that they found it a waste of time and that’s not really a problem. As I looked around a room with a 14:1 ratio of male to female presenting scientists I couldn’t help but concur — I didn’t really see much of this “diversity problem”

More stories? More stories!

I was recently in another room (I do that a lot, it was before COVID really became so alarming, I promise), where I was opening a bank account (yay capitalism!). After missing for approximately 10 minutes with my identification papers, which is definitely not alarming, the account manager resurfaced:  
- “I’m afraid we cannot use your ID”, she said  
- “But how? I have just signed up as a resident using it approximately 30 minutes ago in the town hall. I entered the country using this ID!”  
- “You see, the problem is the corners, they are damaged”. She proceeds to do a demonstration of a problematic corner, _actually damaging my ID card in the process_  
- “But clearly, you see that this is an authentic ID card”  
- “Yes I do, we are not disputing that! But the software doesn’t let us enter an ID if the corners are damaged”  
- “So, you cannot override this?” At this point I am actually laughing, because I know perfectly well where this is going  
- “No, you see, if the software rejects an ID there is nothing we can do. I tried it 3 or 4 times, but it doesn’t let me”

I was too amused to continue, because the story I was reading up while waiting was about [magic opaque algorithms humans can do nothing about](https://themarkup.org/ask-the-markup/2020/03/03/healthcare-algorithms-robot-medicine). I think I just told her I was making a presentation on the topic and laughed my way out. Great day, 10/10.
