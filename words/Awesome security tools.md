Security host monitoring with a free tier


Talk to your company's lawyers before using most of these, lol

### Tried

[https://github.com/brompwnie/botb](https://github.com/brompwnie/botb)

Tried to break out of some containers in the EKS clusters of VanMoof with this, but not much worked :/ 

[https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench)

Benchmarking tool for the CIS recommendations matching of a K8s cluster.
Somewhat useful results, but not too impressive

[https://github.com/derailed/popeye](https://github.com/derailed/popeye)

Pretty legit CLI tool (derailed has also made k9s). Findings were decent and actionable, though the RBAC seems to have been subpar somehow because it failed to list all resource types
