"Tiflomiga" is a greek book written by Evgenia Fakinou. I think it is also a TV series. I've also read "Astradeni" by the same author, but thankfully I was too young to remember.

Here's my descriptions of the book to my partner:

> I just finished one of the cringiest books I've ever read
> 
> So bad, that they made it into a TV series some years ago
> 
> It's a chick flick
> 
> Probably set back the feminist movement in Greece by at least 30 years

> It's so cringe, like oh my god

> There's this beautiful charismatic gorgeous painter and two women are in love with him, his wife and her best friend and they all live in the same house
> 
> But he's also self destructive and cheats oh no
> 
> But they forgive him always because that's his nature and they love him blindly and bla bla bla

> "I can fix him" 

> And then another woman appears that is as narcissistic as him and they have the most awkward holidays with friends in the history of the universe until they eventually have sex
> 
> And then the wife runs away and talks to a crazy old cat lady and a prostitute
> 
> And she is so judgemental about the prostitute, like oh god
> 
> The prostitute is probably legit the only character in the book not saying sth cancellable
> 
> That's *including the narrator* btw, just to make that extra clear
> 
> And the wife treats her like an alien
> 
> And then she goes home and she's angry and she drinks with her best friend
> 
> And they tell the guy she went to another place and he goes there and then he returns
> 
> And they all drink together and what will we make for dinner oh I missed pasta THE END

> Like what???

> 50 pages of cringy flirting and you run out of ink on that particular page?
> 
> Legit there isn't even a closing sentence

> Not horny vibes either
> 
> This shit's surreal
> 
> This is like if the damned poets wrote for the Catholic church

> If they all consented to this relationship from the start honestly it'd be great, good for them
> 
>Like, in the Marquise de Sade's Justine this poor woman has brutal sex with 5 guys BUT SHE STILL CONSENTED FIRST AT LEAST 

> And the descriptions in the book is like if you asked ChatGPT to write an encyclopedia about the world but use only terms that sound from the village
> 
> To sound "authentic"
> 
> Some random character that grew up in a village: "I was thinking about Cape Verde which is anything than green, a barren dark wasteland tortured by the winds and the sea"
> 
> ThingsPeopleSayInTheVillage.jpg

> Thankfully I skipped through some parts at least
> 
> Like at some point a cheated husband has like a 3 page monologue with his wife WHILE SHE'S ASLEEP
> 
> There's like 2 periods on the entire page
> 
> The painter has a drunk sequence which is just artistic sounding gibberish for 5 pages
> 
> But like, he can't keep a thought going for more than 2 words
