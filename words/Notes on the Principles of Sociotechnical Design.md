The paper starts by outlining the following: [Parsons Four subsystems for the survival of a social system](Parsons%20Four%20subsystems%20for%20the%20survival%20of%20a%20social%20system.md)

The 9 principles outlined are: [9 Principles of Sociotechnical Design](9%20Principles%20of%20Sociotechnical%20Design.md)
