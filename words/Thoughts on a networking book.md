# Thoughts on a networking book
> It can be difficult to define a close relation and how you technically build it. But a simple and good
guiding principle can be this VCP composition:
> 1) Visibility. You have to be visible. People need to know who you are.
> 2) Credibility. Next step is to ensure credibility. Who are you, what are you good at?
> 3) Profitability. Then a mutual connection is established. You help each other and make a close/
strong network relation. 


For figuring out how to prioritize your network, ask yourself these questions:
1) What is my vision for the next year?
2) What do I need help with?
3) Who do I know that can help me get there or who do I need to meet to get there?

Networking is about giving – then asking


> More than 60 per cent of all jobs are filled through networking and recommendations, so clearly it is pointless to expect to secure a job interview in the conventional way.

^ Lol this is a pretty BS statement

> Think how often the same experts are repeatedly interviewed in the media. It is the same principle. A journalist turns to the people he already knows when he needs a comment on some news item, a story or an event.

^ This is kinda true tho

> Try to think of an occasion where you felt comfortable in a one-to-one meeting. Were you with someone who was talking a lot about himself, who was selling, and who wasn’t paying attention to what you said?
Surely not. When we feel comfortable, it is often because someone is listening to us, someone who asks about what we have said, someone who is positive about us, someone who understands us the way we want to be understood.

The author identifies 3 stages to communication

> • At the small-talk stage you aim to create a good atmosphere for the person you want to make contact with. It is all about being precise in your communication through your
body language and your voice, and leading the potential conversational partner to want to
progress to the next stage.
• If you reach the second stage, you are probably talking in professional terms or talking
about a common reference topic. Most people feel comfortable in this domain. You have
found something in common, and you are committed to a real conversation with substance.
• The highest stage is intense and personal conversation. Here we talk to each other as good colleagues, friends, and close family.


> Experience shows that the next meeting or phone call ought preferably to take place no later than eight days after you first met.

Looks pulled outta thin air, but not a bad goal to aim for


## Few good pieces of advice

1. Remember always to carry your business cards – which should include all relevant details. A photo on the business card makes it easier to call a person to mind, if you want to contact them later.

2. You will not build a network by sitting in your office and making phone calls. You have to
be physically present at receptions, conferences, trade fairs, networking meetings, courses,
etc. It happens in the field.

3. Obsession with the idea that “networking” is boring and filled with failure needs to be
transformed into something positive: you have to go out and meet new people, who for sure
will be able to contribute one way or another to your life and your business. Think about the
fact that good networks represent power and influence.

4. Your body language signals something about your state of mind, your comfort, and your
energy levels. Always be the best edition of yourself. Remember that we are attracted by
winners and their attitudes. For losers, it’s an uphill struggle; so, if necessary, fake it so long
as a reception or a conference lasts, in order to achieve optimum return from a networking
situation. If you don’t have the strength to do that, or if you cannot force yourself to
summon up the energy you need, then best stay at home this time.

5. Be active! Make contact, introduce yourself, and have always three opening small-talk
questions ready. Examples: What brings you here? Where do you come from? What do
you do? Be a good listener, follow up with questions, and stay on topic. Seek out common
interests or passions. This encourages the possibility of further conversation, and makes it
easier to remember people subsequently.

6. Be good at circulating, so you can talk to lots of people. Remember to close by handing
over your card and making an arrangement about when you will be in contact again. If you
do not arrange a contact, then phone or e-mail no later than the following week. In such a
situation, offer something concrete – a meeting, lunch, or an offer. This makes it easier to
phone, and easier for the other party to relate to the contact.

7. Use small talk to create a good atmosphere, so that other people relax and you will be
relaxed yourself. Be aware of those around you – praise them, talk to them, and let them feel accepted and welcome. If you are a man: be polite, it pays off. For the women it is all about receiving attention and showing happiness when you get it.

8. When we go out to meet new people, we Danes prefer to contact people we already know or who seem similar to ourselves. And that is fine, if we are just out to have fun; but, if it is about business, it is important to move out of our comfort zone and instead be
aware of people who can enrich us with new and different opportunities, approaches, and
perspectives.

9. Choose relevant networks and also individuals in the swim who might benefit your
business. Well-known, admired people are not necessarily difficult to get in contact with.
A determined effort based on serious preparation might help by making the contact more
relevant for that person, and also by dissipating your own nervousness.
Go for gold! No one thanks you for not doing it!
Remember that good networking is also about sharing your own knowledge. What you share will usually be reciprocated.

10. Give yourself and your staff a goal every time you devote a few hours to a reception, a day to a conference, or a week to a course. These networking opportunities should result in at least one new contact for your company – preferably more. By setting this as a goal, you will escape your ego-centredness, and you will turn seeking new contacts into a professional activity. That way, networking can become a sport where the challenge is to do ever better.

12. Make networking a work discipline. Find role models, or be someone who leads the way
and shows how to choose good networks and how to act within them.
Set criteria for what networking activity should contribute to your company. Prioritize the
function and show that it is valued; offer attention to those staff who take this function
seriously, and reward them.
