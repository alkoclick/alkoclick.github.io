Overview:
Straat is a Street Art Museum in Amsterdam. It's in the old NDSM area, which is pretty cool, but getting rapidly gentrified. It's one of my favorite museums in [Amsterdam](../../Amsterdam.md), but sadly they're not on Museumkaart's list, so you have to actually pay the full ticket price :/
