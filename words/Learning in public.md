Learning in public is the practice of being very open about your journey through learning a topic. This helps break down some of the intimidation of doing a "big new thing", it allows you to get easier access to help (if you have the network for it) and most importantly, if you are a senior - it shows that even seniors learn. All in all, it's good from a personal and community side, assuming you have a big enough community.

[[Kelsey Hightower]] does this very well, e.g when he was learning crypto.
