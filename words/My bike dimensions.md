Height: 178
Inseam length: 79cm (69.75 in Lemond)

Recommended size is:
* ML: 56 cm according to trek bikes
* 56-57 according to [evacycles](https://www.evanscycles.com/help/bike-sizing-road)
* Medium according to the [Koga sizer](https://www.koga.com/en/bikes/city-and-touring/colmaro-adventure.htm?frame=H)

My sit-bone width is apparently 15.6 cm, but then I sat on the measuring machine 3 more times and it gave me 12.8, 13.2, then 12.4.
