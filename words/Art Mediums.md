Art often expresses ideas. Those ideas can be expressed in a variety of mediums.

According to quoting websites, Leo Rosten said:
>“If a picture is worth a thousand words, please paint me the Gettysburg Address.”

And even though that's not even in my top 100 pieces of words to paint, that intention makes sense. How can you convert a symphony into words, how can you "translate" Lord of the Rings to a dance? Hell, we do it all the time with films and we always end up saying "the book is better" right? But in the end the book is different than the film, different than the soundtrack, and the stills.

The video makes an argument that an idea has a best-fitting medium of expression and is best represented there. The artist (ideator?) then needs to hopefully find that medium and use it to the best of their ability to deliver that concept to an audience.

Sidenote: Is that why the writing/blogging platform is named Medium?
