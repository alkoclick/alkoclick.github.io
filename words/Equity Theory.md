# Equity theory

A well functioning group will try to distribute resources fairly to keep everyone happy

> **Equity theory** focuses on determining whether the distribution of resources is fair to both relational partners. Equity is measured by comparing the ratio of contributions (or costs) and benefits (or rewards) for each person.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_theory#cite_note-1) Considered one of the justice theories, equity theory was first developed in the 1960s by J. Stacy Adams, a [workplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_psychology "Workplace psychology") and [behavioral psychologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_psychology "Behavioral psychology"), who asserted that employees seek to maintain equity between the inputs that they bring to a job and the outcomes that they receive from it against the perceived inputs and outcomes of others (Adams, 1963). According to Equity Theory, in order to maximize individuals' rewards, we tend to create systems where resources can be fairly divided amongst members of a group. Inequalities in relationships will cause those within it to be unhappy to a degree proportional to the amount of inequality.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_theory#cite_note-2) The belief is that people value fair treatment which causes them to be motivated to keep the [fairness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice "Justice") maintained within the relationships of their co-workers and the organization. The structure of equity in the workplace is based on the ratio of inputs to outcomes. Inputs are the contributions made by the employee for the organization.
