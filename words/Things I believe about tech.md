### All tech is political
It's created by humans, who are biased imperfect creatures

### The best code is no code
Some things should not be built. Some things should not be maintained.

### Your career is not coding. Your career is writing
Sometimes that writing is code, sometimes it's communications. Train that writing skill

### Code and docs should be optimised for reading not writing
Your 10 minutes are multiplied across 10s or hundreds of people, multiple times over

### There is an optimal medium for sharing every idea
Text isn't always the best choice but people still use it because it's the easiest. You have text, audio, video, diagrams, async and live presentations at your disposal

### The most important skills you will learn in your career are not technological
If you can learn to read SQL, you can learn to read people's body language (and other nonverbal communication cues).
