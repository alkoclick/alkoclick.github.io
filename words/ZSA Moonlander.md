This is my new keyboard, as of joining [[Miro]]! It's pretty cool, but it took some time to build a layout that really works for me. I am also feeling I have to be careful not to build something that's too custom and then I can't work on my standard laptop keyboard.

Layouts can be edited at [link](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/n6gV0/latest/0)

I actually decided to go for this keyboard after taking [[Cassidy Williams]]'s email course on mechanical keyboards.
