Scenarios in tool 1 are really cool. Could I somehow discuss them with colleagues?

> As you review each future scenario, CONSIDER: 
• What is your greatest worry in this scenario? 
• How might different users be affected differently by this future? 
• What actions would you take to safeguard privacy, truth, democracy, mental health, civic discourse, equality of opportunity, economic stability, or public safety? 
• What could we be doing now to get ready for this risky future?

Picking out Scenario 14:
> Self-driving vehicles become vulnerable to a new type of realtime ransomware. Hackers access the car remotely, turn off the engine, and refuse to start the car again until the driver pays a ransom. Typically this is a minor, commonplace inconvenience for small amounts of money. At worst, these attacks are timed and staged at dangerous locations—such as on train tracks, shortly before a train is scheduled to approach—for much larger ransoms.

* My biggest worry is human loss of life and injuries
* A wave of folks will die due to engine shutoffs in dangerous circumstances
* A new wave of survivors will need mental health resources
* Technophobia may explode in popularity, as people feel terrified at the near-death experiences they could not control
* These attacks will probably be driven by hackers from less affluent countries, targeting faraway affluent users, as that's the most efficient way to set up the system for them (money-wise, regulation-wise, community-wise). The backlash may create a wave of xenophobia, as it's easier to blame the "Chinese hackers" than the bad security of "American Self Driving Vehicles"

Actions that can be taken then:
* Immediate mass recall of the commercial product
* Offensive cybersecurity against the hackers (e.g disabling their C&CCs)
* (Sounds hard) Freeze the payment systems used? 

Actions that can be taken now:
* Build stronger, easier to use security systems
* Research additional defensive security measures
* Build kill switches that disable all "remote" functionality into these smart devices
* (Unsure) Increase friction on some of the completely anonymous systems used for payments now?
