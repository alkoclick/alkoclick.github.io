* Maximize (pleasant?) time spent with loved ones

It's hard to establish a metric for "pleasant". But removing the condition means that a lifetime of horrible experiences with someone you love has the same weight as a life of amazing experiences with someone you love. Is that true?

Some natural outcome of the maximising time is that maximising life (and that of loved ones) is also useful

Scheduling time is also good, and making that time pleasant is probably good regardless of metrics
