# My last Instagram post
It's been a few months and everything has more or less fallen together. What a wonderful puzzle life is, anyway!  
  
I won't bother you too much with the details. I'm happy and that's what counts. I'm happy with the way I live. I'm happy with the way I talk, the way I act. For the first time in 24 years, I'm happy with the way I look.  
But life always has more in store. I'm still the same person with the hopes and dreams and confidence and insecurities I had a few months ago. That's okay. It's okay for you too, to be hopeful and dreamful and scared. Oh to trully feel - this, is, in my strictly personal opinion, the meaning of life.  
  
I quit this network because it was making me unproductive and lonely. The people I know here are such wonderful, mutifaceted individuals - yet behind this screen they are reduced to nothing but swipable personalities. Swipe left, swipe right, swipe up. We've achieved a zero-sum game for socializing. Tinder, but for your friends. That's not what I wanted or intended.  
I hope to see you all, somewhere, sometime. Share a beer, or coffee, or tea or water. Share a story. Share the things that bring us together in a time where the most successful moves are the ones that promote your self-interests.  
  
No. It doesn't have to be that way.  
  
I am convinced you are more than a profile. More than followers, more than your everyday stories. And from the bottom of my heart I wish you the very best.  
  
Because my winning move is not to play.
