Thorsrud, "Policy making as a learning process", 1972

1. The need for the content of a job to be reasonably demanding of the worker in terms other than sheer endurance, and to provide a minimum of variety (not necessarily novelty)
2. The need to be able to learn on the job and go on learning
3. The need for some minimal area of decision-making the individual can call their own
4. The need for the individual to be able to relate what they do and what they produce to their social circle
5. The need to feel that the job leads to some sort of desirable future (not necessarily promotion)
