But what about the digital world?

I don't know whether we can have enchanted digital objects. The now classic essay [[The Colour of Bits]] touches upon a similar topic. The author argues that a specific arrangement of bits may be special, based purely on its provenance - where it came from. The author makes a very extended point on how computer scientists are trained not to see the "colour" (provenance) of bits because computers can't perceive it, yet society values the understanding of that property.

Yet when you are able to make infinite, perfect copies of an object, could you have uniqueness? Especially given that a bunch of computer operations are not "move these bits around" but rather "copy these bits somewhere else, then erase the original". I feel most people don't perceive that when moving a photo from their camera's flash drive to their computer creates a perfect copy and removes the original, yet that's precisely what is happening.

For rewriting:
What about your WoW character, a level 75 night elf with a collection of mighty items? Another user could build the same character and give them the same items, even join the same clans as you, yet if you sat at their computer you would inherently know that you are playing another character.

Just to address that: Yes, I'm aware of NFTs, but no, I don't think they add anything meaningful to this discussion.

* Flesh out an explanation of how we perceive digital objects vs how they actually are
