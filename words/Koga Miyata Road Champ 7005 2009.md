The Koga Miyata Road Champ was launched in 2004. My version is from 2009. 
You can also view a brochure featuring it [here](attachments/Brochure_2009.pdf).

It's not a great picture, but here's what it looks like.

Frame number:
* KG0913582 (Sticker)
* H8CB02298 (Engraved)

I bought from the old owner of my house, for 400€. Seems to be a bit overpaid, especially with the condition of some components, but such is life.  It's not too too far from a [fair price](https://retrobikerotterdam.com/products/koga-miyata-road-champ-60cm).

Bike frame size is 54. It's probably a tad small for me. See [My bike dimensions](My%20bike%20dimensions.md).

## Service history:

#### 2025-08-16
I had a flat tire on 2025-08-07. The cause was a bad tile on the way back from the gym. I went to "Amsterdam bike store" nearby, but the owner, slightly abrupt refused to sell me a tire because I wasn't certain about my valve. I ordered a tire online from bol.com, but I thought it was the wrong size (28-622) because of how large it was and I returned it. Thankfully the roadside kit had a spare in it, so I replaced that on 2025-08-16. 

#### 2025-08-27
I set up the bike repair stand and examined the bike closely. The chain seems to be slightly worn, but not too bad. I got a picture of the tires, that seem to be pretty worn out and old. I adjusted the brakes position, especially in the front wheel because they were completely sideways and bending the wheel. Both wheels seem to be slightly untrue. The front wheel seems to have a slight vibration to it. I adjusted the positioning of the magnet for the [Sigma BC 7.16 bike computer](Sigma%20BC%207.16%20bike%20computer.md) slightly. I noticed a slight clicking sound in the front wheel but it turned out to be caused by the bike computer magnet.

#### 2025-11-27
The bike computer has moved to the [Koga Miyata Roadspeed 1999](Koga%20Miyata%20Roadspeed%201999.md) some time ago. I removed the handlebar grips and added tape instead.
