* Add something for basic stats
	* Probably needs self-hosting to avoid blocking by scripts
	* Tried GoatCounter, Fathom also looks interesting
	* https://github.com/cloudcommunity/Cloud-Free-Tier-Comparison
* Try to actually render the correct build time of pages
* Add some sort of search functionality
* Add some organizing by tags, or pages collecting those articles as links
* Try embedding again
