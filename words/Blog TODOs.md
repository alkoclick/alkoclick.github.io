Optional, future:
* Add something for basic stats
	* Probably needs self-hosting to avoid blocking by scripts
	* Tried GoatCounter, Fathom also looks interesting
	* [Cloud Free Tier](Cloud%20Free%20Tier.md)
* Try to actually render the correct build time of pages
* Add some sort of search functionality
* Add some organizing by tags, or pages collecting those articles as links
  * Can probably use some Obsidian plugin for this that automatically maintains pages with link to all posts with a tag
* Add Mastodon link to social: [https://github.com/jekyll/minima#social-networks](https://github.com/jekyll/minima#social-networks)
