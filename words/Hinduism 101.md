I'm obviously very, very far from even knowing the basics here, but these are my notes for building my understanding

* Not a single unified concept
* No single prophet or holy book
* Intensely diverse and inclusive of its variations
* Questioning authority and itself, in search of eternal truth
* Nonviolence, especially to higher forms of life such as animals, leads to high numbers of vegetarians and vegans

The word "religion", which implies a systematic church and a specific dogma, doesn't exactly capture the essence of Hinduism. Its supporters prefer the word "Dharma", which translates more to "way of life".


## Key concepts
Many forms of Hinduism embrace the following concepts

#### Dharma
* Following the universal order (rta), of both the physical and spiritual realm
* duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and "right way of living"


#### Artha
* Providing for yourself and your family
* Includes politics, diplomacy, anything that enables financial security basically
* I wonder if this includes professions traditionally seen as unethical, e.g prostitution? Or does that violate the dharma?


#### Kama
* The search for worldly pleasures, in all their forms
* Unlike Catholics, it's accepted to have fun, even recommended


#### Moksha
* Freedom from sorrow, suffering and the samsara (birth-rebirth cycle)
* They made the buddhism reference kinda on the nose there
* Changes a fair amount across different schools of Hinduism


## God
Okay, god is a complex thing here. Remember that there are like, a gazillion variations each with their own ideas. Some generally common themes are:
* There is a supreme god
* The god has many manifestations
* It's okay if there are more gods, no fighting

#### Supreme god
* Pick your fave: Shiva, Durga, Lakshmi, Vishnu are all treated as the supreme god

#### [[Personal god]]
* This is a pretty cool concept
* iṣṭa devatā, or chosen ideal
* Basically a manifestation of the supreme god that you choose to worship as your personal one
* May be influenced by locality, culture, caste
