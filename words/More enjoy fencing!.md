Hey kids!

Happy 2020! I saw on a meme that its binary representation is 1111000. I didn’t check that, because I knew [I can always trust Facebook to deliver fact-checked advertisements](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/technology/facebook-political-ads-lies.html)… right?

Oof, starting hot off the bat there! Welcome to the show folks, come right in, take a seat, take a seat!

It’s been quite some time since the last post as real life caught up with me, hard. Things are fun though, thanks for asking! Moving to Amsterdam in a month for a new DevOps position and I am quite excited about that!

What’s happened since?

### Work / life balance!

One thing that I’ve wanted to discuss for quite some time is the issue of having a healthy, balanced and all-around awesome workplace. In the tech industry it’s something people pay a lot of attention to, because honestly, they can afford to be picky about their job.

[The Away story](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20995453/away-luggage-ceo-steph-korey-toxic-work-environment-travel-inclusion) recently broke out, prompting many to discuss, once again, what we consider “part of startup culture” and how much is that worth it. I mean, people used to work in factories 12 hours a day, right? And sweatshops are still a thing. The hustle is definitely one of the things that characterizes the millenial generation. Perhaps I am extrapolating from my own experiences here, but a lot of people I know work really hard for the things they want. Where does that stop?

I definitely encourage you to read the write up above, not just for the tech drama _(confirmed to be the primary entertainment for multiple cool kids)_, but for the early signs of a dysfunctional corporate culture and how you can survive and avoid it. For the record, after the story was publicised, a lot of VCs (Venture Capitalists, the people investing in startupds) chimed loudly about their admiration towards Corey’s _“relentless drive”_ and _“strong work ethic”_. [Two weeks later, she was promptly fired.](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1204170491230994432). The discussions ensuing also turned to [“should you overwork in your 20s?”](https://twitter.com/tenlinesofcode/status/1209691562805850112) which sounds like a weird question to ask, doesn’t it?

It doesn’t have to be a toxic environment either for you to want something else, as [one shocked manager found out](https://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/148477/how-to-deal-with-an-employee-who-is-requesting-a-demotion). While building a career is obviously a priority for many, it’s not for all. Some people love to just have a working environment that respects them, does not push them above and beyond and actually allows them to… live? Full disclosure here — this is not how I have lived my life and I am happy for the many things I have achieved with my (much more than required) hard work. However, I have started to think that what I achieved was not because of overworking, but in spite of it.

More enjoy regards,  
Alexander P.
