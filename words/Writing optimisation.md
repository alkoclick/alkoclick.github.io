This is a very raw thought that I've been exploring with my friend Panos during a call.

I had the thesis that optimising for readers is usually the way to go, let's examine that

Time spent writing >=< readers * time spent reading


5 min read
5 readers

25 min spent writing max?


On the eyes of the company:
Time spent writing + readers * time spent reading = 50min

But if you spend 5 min optimizing the read down to 2 min
30 min for you
10 for them
40 for the company!

This is all pretty simple nice math

Simple example: Technical onepager decision record
15 min write
4 readers
2 min read time
23min company time

Expected outcome: Inform, provide discussion platform for async feedback

Alternatively, that time would invested in:
* 4 person 30m meeting
* Directly building the thing
	* Decision is bad:
		* Build time of 3h is gone
		* Significant potential risks
		* Has to be rolled back, more time
		* New decision has to be made
	* Decision is good:
		* Stakeholders have not been informed, their systems are affected
			* How long will discovery take?
			* Fastest path:
				* 5min Slack+Confluence search
				* 5min writing to an eng
				* 10 mins of bouncing around folks, end up in the correct team
				* ? chance that Pan or the approver are currently available
				* Wall clock time is at least 8h probably due to async!
			* Slowest path:
				* Discovery is days or never

Optimal outcome: Someone shares info, saving a future project a lot of time

What about reading comprehension?
