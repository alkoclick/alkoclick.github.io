These are my notes from watching [The Interactive Pasts Conference 3](https://interactivepasts.com/the-interactive-pasts-conference-3/).

## Intro & Welcome
* If you weren't aware, Value foundation runs this
* 47 abstracts, 21 received
* Fortnite branded nerf guns as a timekeeping mechanism - interesting

## Playing with wisdom tree
Dr Frang G Bosman
* Dude has an amazing vest, really colorful with Dali-like shapes
* Let's talk about Bible games, that never hurt anyone lol
* "Let me already tell you, they're not the best quality on the market"
* Humor's on point
* Theatrical presentation helps freshen up his definitions and intro segment
* Oh no, videos can't be played? What will professor theology do? Fight Bag Item Run
* He's choosing to... request IT support from the conf organizers. Bold strategy, let's see how it plays out
* Looks like he managed to stand through the YT video loadings and even the ad part
* Why Christian games usually suck in 4 bullets:
	* Bad history of sucky past games taints the genre
	* Focus on narrative, ignore everything else, and contradiction between the message and the medium
	* Too focused on evangelizing, so you are automatically primed to block it
	* Too focused on the "Christian" part of Christian games, so they lose some of the audience because of the identification

## A Digital Hajj
Tyler Kynn, PHD
* Presenter co-created the Hajj trail game, inspired by Oregon Trail
* https://www.hajjtrail.com/
* "Too often Ottomans are presented in negative contexts of violence and war in the media" - this game aims to provide a more balanced perspective to the history
* Now describing part of his dissertation which is somebody's journal when they travelled from Sarajevo to Mecca
* So why a game instead of a book or text? Because it can convey things such as time in a way that a book cannot. It can also provide an experience in first person and allow self-identifying with the protagonist in a way a book can't.
* Looks like the somebody (who was Bosnian btw) was pretty shocked to find a desert and lack of water (massively reductionist take on the presentation's message)
* "The greatest challenge of the Ottoman empire was distance, and time required to cross it"
* Used twinery.org for organizing the storytelling
* Different pilgrims took different journeys - such as a longer one for visiting relatives for example

## The Archaeology Awakens
Amanda Pina
* "Teaching art and technology should not be just confined to academic books" - Preach!
* Okay the contents slide is pretty long, lol
* Cyber-Archaeology "The utilization of cybernetic tools to build archaeological scenarios" - cyberpunk.avi
* Archaeogaming: The study of archaeology within and around videogames
* 40 interviews in general
* Ok I feel kinda cheated at this point, this is like a work presentation
* I do respect the research though
* So the game she's building is 2d mobile point&click, inspired by Spiritfarer


## Q & A time!
* "Are Christian games so different than other educational games that force education upon you?"
	* Well, on one path you can have a game that starts as entertainment and adds a message on top. On the other path, you have things like serious games, that start with a message and then build a product around that. It feels like the former makes for more enjoyable games
* Second question I didn't catch, but was about Wisdom Tree trying to just find a market for their games
	* Unclear how much they were Christian, but they were capitalist
* How do you reconcile the contemporary maps in the path to Hajj with the realism of travel times which are inaccurate on those maps?
* "Do some religions have more affordances for play and are thus more exciting to develop as games?"
	* Frank: Looking from a cultural Christian perspective, I'd say that the Roman catholic tradition is quite strong: Popes to murder, Nuns and Priests doing things to one another, but for example there aren't that many Protestant games
	* Tyler: In the Islamic world, Islam is wildly undrerrepresented and ignored, e.g as the Assassin's Creed series has progressed to basically erase Islam from Baghdad
* No questions to Amanda? Rude, when we got 6 questions to the other 2 male speakers

## Playing the most ancient games: AI and the archaeological record of play
Walter Crist and Cameron Browne
* The most ancient board game in the world is from an egyptian woman's tomb and is in... Brussels museum /eyeroll
* Boards, pieces and dice often the only remains
* There are problems with finding ancient board games
	* People often played by just drawing shapes in the sand/ground and adding some rocks, can't find that
	* Graffiti, especially because the Roman soldiers were generally dicks to walls
* Ludeme: A little piece of game information that determines the rules, and can be easily transmitted and communicated among players. Discover enough ludemes and you understand the game
* Games were largely passed down or communicated from parents to children for example, or among friends. Only near the 20th century did we start having the "store bought game" concept with an included rulebook
* They developed a tool, Ludii and a game description language that aims to be human readable
* "There already exists a Stanford Game description language, but that's not really human readable"
* They've created a database of games that are free and open access in their page
* Per game you have rules, background, sources and references, looks super cool
* Sorry no notes I'm having fun looking up games in https://ludii.games/library.php
* They can automate the process of reconstruction partially, by using automated AI players
* Oh no, we're short on time!
* They recently got a grant and want to build a network of anthropologists, archaeologists and AI folks to help reconstruct more of these ancient games

## Replaying early videogame history
Matthew Michaud, Shankar Ganesh, John Aycock, Katie Biittner & Carl Therrien
* What happened between 1972 and 1977 when the Atari released?
* 1976: Let's talk about Fairchild channel F
* Huh, apparently it introduced cartridges
* It was a different time - the games were both hardware and software and platforms were not as ingrained as today
* Looks like they also introduced handheld controllers, with an interestingly phallic shape
* Huh, Fairchild also introduced the pause feature
* So, the researchers built an AI system to play and analyze these games
* Interestingly, the cartrdige and BIOS coverage is pretty low on this game - possibly they were run alongside other games on the same cartridge
* A lot of our archives from the time comes from Lawson, one of the first African-American videogame engineers
* Lawson initially worked at Fairchild semiconductors, then left to build his own company, Videosoft
* Lawson testified in a couple of high-level lawsuits, like Fairchild vs Nintendo
* Lawson's diagrams are frequently annotated, which gives us more context into the design process and his thoughts, often concerned with maximizing the usage of the controller's functionality
* He annotated one of the docs for "Math Quiz", an early game with "No Fun, No Teaching". They extensively focused on "fun" also on their marketing materials
* "To conclude, so that I don't get the 21 gun salute here" - lol
* Understanding the development of a console requires studying not just the code of the games, but also the console's engineering, and the context in which they occurred

## Using the tools of the present to explore the past through digital interactive narrative design
Sahar Mirhadi, Callum Deery, Florence Smith Nicholls, Sunny Thaicharoen & Amy Smith
* Jesus that's a long title
* Game made in a gamejam
* "Agony Haunt" is the name of the game
* The player plays as a mystic and chooses how to respond to various clients
* They really liked the Victorian era as a setting
* They started by going to Chat GPT3 to begin the process of generating scenarios
* It was a collab between ChatGPT and humans
* Oh no, the model pushed back against their requests - the responses were called "sassy"
* They had to basically build a whole context in chatGPT with a fictional setting
* Let's compare with a human-written story:
* Can ChatGPT do satire or criticism of established practices in the era, such as colonial archaeology - left for future researchers
* They used Midjourney to generate a lot of the imagery
* Prompt engineering yay! Looks like they needed various iterations to get to the correct result
* Reflections
	* AI helped solve the "blank canvas" issue
	* The image in Midjourney is pretty capable, didn't resist as much as ChatGPT3 (but they didn't try obscene stuff)
	* There was stuff that the model added, such as fashion and home decor, which was correct, even without being specified
* Animating - Let's use AI for that as well!
* Use Pixamotion, an app to provide animations using an AI engine. That provided some good results with minimal time investments
* The tech is currently cheap, though probably will get paywalled soon
* It's hard to get continuity of character - doable but takes a lot of work
* Assets are typically very large and require post-proc
* Fundamental issues
	* Continuity of world in writing
	* Lots of anachronisms
	* Specific styles are hard
	* Concerns about environment, paying artists
* Final thoughts
	* Good for short timeframe tools
	* Can augment human creativity, not replace it

## Q & A time!
* You've been reconstructing board games: Are any of them actually good?
	* For many folks they look less modern, but some hold up. Presenter personally likes Senet
* How was the tension in creative freedom vs self-filtering in AIs?
	* Sahar: It's getting better, but due to the nature of humans we need to keep trying to make it safer
	* Callum: Disagrees with that and says that they're not getting safer, they just pretend to and hastily patch up some surface weaknesses when there's a big scandal, e.g Google and adding the gorilla label to black folx
	* Amy: This tension is there and can be helpful for fundamental artistic thoughts and goals such as activism for example
* Were there 3rd party games made for Channel F?
	* Fairchild got out of the game business eventually, probably wisely and sold off to another company
	* Not too many games, about 20 in total
* More questions that I'm tired to write atm
