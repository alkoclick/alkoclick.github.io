[Dark triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_triad)

> Three antisocial personality traits: narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy
> People scoring high on these traits are more likely to commit crimes, cause social distress, and create severe problems for organizations, especially if they are in leadership positions. [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_triad#cite_note-8) They also tend to be less compassionate, agreeable, empathetic, satisfied with their lives, and less likely to believe they and others are good

Okay "Machiavellianism" is a pretty hardcore trait for anyone to have, tbh. I originally stumbled on this due to the work of [[Natalie J Allen]]
