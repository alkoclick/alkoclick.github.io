[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociotechnical_system) says:
>**Sociotechnical systems** (**STS**) in [organizational development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_development "Organizational development") is an approach to complex organizational [work design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_design "Work design") that recognizes the interaction between [people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People "People") and [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology") in [workplaces](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Workplace "wiktionary:Workplace"). The term also refers to coherent systems of human relations, technical objects, and [cybernetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics "Cybernetics") processes that inhere to large, complex infrastructures. Social society, and its constituent substructures, qualify as complex sociotechnical systems.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociotechnical_system#cite_note-1)

The theory is excellent, and it is interesting to me how concepts like "Sociotechnical design" have a rich history of research and discussion, yet the tech industry seems to rediscover them seemingly as a novel thing every few decades. I learned about it during one such cycle around 2020.

I've done a presentation about sociotechnical systems at Miro on 2023: [Sociotechnical systems in action](Sociotechnical%20systems%20in%20action.md).
