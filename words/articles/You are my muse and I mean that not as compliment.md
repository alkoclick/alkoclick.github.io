It's been a while since the last one, hasn't it? And yet, not much feels different, at least not for me. You know, all good "content creator" and "influencer" guides will teach you that you have to stick to a cadence and train the audience on it. The crucial mistake those guides do is assume I want to build an audience (so I can monetize it of course) rather than commit thoughts to digital paper in the hopes of exiling them from my head.

We're still in a pandemic, though we learned to look the other way. We still got some forever wars ravaging the globe ([donate to Ukraine btw](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QJ1m6N9dXa3z0sGHKDYNd1salhxaI72pDbVeY4gBShE/htmlview#)). Crypto is still [full of grift](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/), though much of the techbro ecosystem around is pivoting to AI grift. Business as usual.

The third once-in-a-lifetime crisis of my lifetime is at the gates! Banks are collapsing left and right, but none of their announcement managed to capture the feeling better than Silvergate, a bank whose chief editor seems to be allergic to negative words.

>The Company sold additional debt securities in January and February 2023 and expects to record further losses related to the other-than-temporary impairment on the securities portfolio. These additional losses will negatively impact the regulatory capital ratios of the Company and the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Silvergate Bank (the "Bank"), and could result in the Company and the Bank being less than well-capitalized. In addition, the Company is evaluating the impact that these subsequent events have on its ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of its financial statements. . – Silvergate’s [Notification of Late Filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1312109/000110465923027353/tm238251d1_nt10k.htm)

After VanMoof's fourth round of layoffs in a year, I also found my contract "less than renewed". Don't worry though, I wasn't the only one! The president was promoted to "consultant" for a short while which made me think of the following meme:

A short and sweet round of interviews landed me at [Miro](https://medium.com/miro-engineering), an organisation that I have been excited to join due to its ██████ and ███████. I especially love the ███████ tech they use to ████ ███ █.████. Did I mention that their social media policy is somewhat restrictive? Please don't take that negatively though ; please, I beg you, I am not allowed to engage in blogging that could tarnish the company's reputation.

Okay, unironically though, it is a super nice place to work at. The offices are cool, the people I meet and work with every day are some of the top I've met in my career. You can  check out our [careers](https://miro.com/careers/open-positions/) page. If you have the opportunity to work there I'd wholeheartedly recommend it! And if you want a piece of more factual evidence [here's my paycheck data](https://elk.zone/hachyderm.io/@alkoclick/109961691533243967).

Two thoughts on that last part:
1) I struggled with whether I wanted to share my pay data openly for a while, but hey I think the only way that we make this whole capitalism thing more fair is by sharing information, right?
2) You'll notice that last one is a link to the Fediverse, specifically my new home of Hachyderm.io. It's been great over there honestly, and I really enjoy the community and feeling. Give it a try!

Anxious that my mere presence in a room was not annoying enough by itself, I used part of my Miro onboarding bonus to finally take the plunge into clicky mechanic keyboards: I ended up choosing the beautiful ZSA Moonlander seen below (yes I've removed some keys):

I've been wanting to cover so many things over the past year, but I didn't have that much energy, and I also spent some time focusing on other things (and I don't just mean my new [sideproject, Eikona](https://github.com/alkoclick/eikona)). You'll notice that there are a fair amount of Twitter links because this is from the "before" times. So, here it goes:

For starters, in an effort to please a wide range of crowds, I'll give you a story about [providing internet to Kazakhstan](https://www.codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/kazakhstan-shut-down-its-internet-these-programmers-opened-a-backdoor/), and a story about [taking North Korea's internet away](https://www.wired.com/story/north-korea-hacker-internet-outage/). Fun fact: North Korea's internet has been involved in high profile stories before, when [The Pirate Bay "migrated" there for a few days](https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-moves-to-north-korea-gets-virtual-asylum-130304/).

Oh wait I almost forgot this story about the internet of British Columbia (which btw is currently neither related to Britain, nor Colombia?) [being eaten by a beaver](https://twitter.com/netblocks/status/1536416663385546756?t=rM5ab-TNsV_59xtUjMDdsQ).

The customer is always right, especially when [the customer has nuclear weapons](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=95644#c4).

On Fediverse, Twitter and towers, there was a beautiful quote from this Wired article title [God did us a favor by destroying Twitter](https://www.wired.com/story/god-did-us-a-favor-by-destroying-twitter/).

> How will these smaller groups of happier people be monetized? This is a tough question for the billionaires. Happy people, the kind who eat sandwiches together, are boring. They don’t buy much. Their smartphones are six versions behind and have badly cracked screens. They fix bicycles, then they talk about fixing bicycles, then they show their friend, who just came over for no reason, how they fixed their bicycle, and their friend says, “Wow, good job,” and they make tea. That doesn’t seem like enough to build a town square on.

On the same vein, Cat Valente wrote "[Stop talking to each other and start buying things](https://catvalente.substack.com/p/stop-talking-to-each-other-and-start)", which is one of those once-a-year articles that you really should spend your evening reading. Trust me.

I'm gonna wind down the crypto stuff since honestly, it's winding itself down (thankfully). As goodbye presents, here's the [Cryptoland presentation which remains the absolute pinnacle of Web3](https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1478500436873293828) and [a compilation of the crocodile of Wall street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYo4jNvQ0y4).

Thoughts by the lovely Corey Quinn on "[the bus problem](https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1377737856232255489) ".

YouTube still works as expected, that is if you expect it to [take down its own guidelines on acceptable usage](https://twitter.com/Talen_Lee/status/1509887583743983622?t=AzGKetFqUaFGhWdT2qnh1A) and ban [random academic channels](https://twitter.com/BryanVanNorden/status/1534520346560323585) for including samples of a movie from the 30s whose copyright has probably expired.

Speaking of expired copyright, Winnie the Pooh's copyright has expired which led to exciting new projects such as "[Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3E74j_xFtg)". Hot on its heels comes "[Mad Heidi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjGIWcOrq-I)". Warning that both these trailers are kinda NSFW.

You probably know by now that I am not very patient at writing these article endings. So, as a closing thought: here's the song that inspired this title: [You will see me by Scroobius Pip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0gNWUMl8t0). Maybe you will indeed see me in a couple of weeks again.
