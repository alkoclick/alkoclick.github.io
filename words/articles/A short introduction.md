### A short introduction

I recently wrote the following short piece for [my Github profile](https://github.com/alkoclick). I‚Äôm also posting it here, because I‚Äôd like the Medium folks to have an idea of who is the person (or cat) behind this keyboard.

Hi there üëã

### Intro

I‚Äôm Alexandros Papageorgiou Koufidis, a DevOps-focused software developer from Greece, currently living in Amsterdam. Besides creating good software, I believe in diversity of thoughts, bodies and minds, as an inclusive way to address the inequalities we face today and may face tomorrow.

### Quick bio

At 18, I started working various entry-level jobs. At 21, and while interning as a SysAdmin for my university I developed an app for hobby games sellers to automatically price their products based on various algorithms and strategies. Next year I dropped out of university and moved to Poland for romance, while working remotely at a VR game development startup. After going back to Greece, I started a hobby games web store with a friend, then moved to Switzerland when I started working for CERN. On the same year, 2019, I also cofounded Thalatta, a software development startup. After CERN I pivoted to DevOps and worked at Zivver, a secure communications company in Amsterdam. I‚Äôm currently doing cloud development work for VanMoof, a high-tech ebike scaleup.
