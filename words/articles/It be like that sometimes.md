Hey cool kids!

### [Nice, nice baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rog8ou-ZepE)!

Have you heard the news? GitHub has [taken “code freeze” to a whole new level](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-11-13/microsoft-apocalypse-proofs-open-source-code-in-an-arctic-cave)! After the [ICE contract controversy](https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/microsoft-owned-github-defends-work-with-ice-employee-resigns-2019-11), it kinda made sense (if nothing else, then for the SEO on the google result “GitHub ice”). Thinking about switching over? While you’re definitely not the only one,

### Here’s your round of twitter and other news

-   [Some readup on algorithms and equality](https://twitter.com/ubiquity75/status/1193596702466293760)
-   [A group of activists disturbingly collected faces for their cause](https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/1195100706669240320) (but I probably could have worded that better)
-   [When you hear the words DeepFake and CEO, you expect something juicier tbh](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/09/05/scammers-deepfake-ceos-voice-to-talk-underling-into-243000-transfer/)
-   [I swear I’m not making this up](https://www.techspot.com/news/82740-iowa-hired-cybersecurity-firm-do-penetration-testing-arrested.html)

Going through this again, I realize that the stories on misuse of neural networks keep growing and growing. Definitely something to keep an eye on…

### No tech drama this week?

Yeah, mostly. With KubeCon going on in Sad Diego, everyone’s being like, super nice and stuff. Except Bob, who has been shouting into the void since last week. Ugh.

### Now, let’s go back in time

In the industry, you may often hear the concept of the 10x engineer being spoken of. These mythical creatures were born in the underbellies of Big 4 and galvanized through generations of critical, industry turning, moments, such as when they [redefined cluster computing in a basement to save Google](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge). Rumored to be capable of writing code at 10 times the productivity of a “normal dev” have many times been ousted as hoaxes and/or toxic elements to any company. It has lately become a hot topic again, but this time the software community is more prepared to face them in a [more appropriate way](http://10x.engineer/). With cooler voices prevailing, the concept of the [1x engineer](https://1x.engineer/) is starting to take hold. Not a hotshot, [not a rockstar](https://twitter.com/CHERdotdev/status/1197171046241189888), just an average ideal IT person, whom you’d like to have in your company. Both professionally and socially.

And now that you’re caught up on all the lingo and the like, here’s some juicy Python for you. I know a lot of cool kids are into data and AI and everything that involves a snake somewhere in the codebase. Now, this is a story that was put out back in 2016, when Big Data was still _Hot Shit_. It largely represents the highest point of the big data industry at the time. Without further delays, folks, please enjoy reading [the circle line rogue train!](https://blog.data.gov.sg/how-we-caught-the-circle-line-rogue-train-with-data-79405c86ab6a)

And finally, for those of you with a more entrepreneurial flair, here’s some [DHH summarizing much of the startup scene’s feelings](https://medium.com/signal-v-noise/reconsider-41adf356857f)

May your day never match your expectations,
