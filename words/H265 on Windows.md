Apparently Microsoft are greedy mofos and they actually charge you for installing the HEVC/HEIC video codes (!), otherwise known as H.265. These are extremely popular on most mobile devices, and my DJI Osmo Action 4 also uses them.  

Normally, you can download it via the Microsoft Store for 1$. However, if you follow this [random YT vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4j0kuH8_M4), you'll find this link to get the codecs directly:
