I got this bike for 25 euro from Marktplaats, a dutch classifieds site. As I was told (and is easy to see), it's been sitting in a barn for over 20 years. I've been wanting to restore it, and then either use it or sell it. As a challenge, I decided to stick to a sub-100 euro budget for this work.

It took me a while to identify it. The bottom bracket sticker mentioned PH10S (which I initially read as PHIOS), and there was another sticker for the Carbolite 103 steel. The year is still unknown, though I found [someone](https://peugeot-vintage.myportfolio.com/ph10) claiming that 1981 was the last year that Peugeot had their lion logo facing right. Unclear if this is true, but I did find some pics of a similar model from 1983 where the lion is facing left.

This is how it looked on pickup day:

 And this is how it looked after some much needed washing and removing the initial layer of handlebar tape:
