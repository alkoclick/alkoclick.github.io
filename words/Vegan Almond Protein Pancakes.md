#### Ingredients:

Creates about 6 pancakes

- 100g almond flour
- 15g plain (all-purpose) flour
- 20g chocolate-flavored protein powder
- ½ tsp (2.5g) baking powder
- ½ tsp (1–2g) ground cinnamon
- Pinch of salt
- 1 tbsp (10–15g) brown sugar
- 130ml soya milk
- 1 tsp (5ml) fresh lemon juice
- Coconut oil or vegan butter for cooking

#### Instructions:

1. In a bowl, whisk together the almond flour, plain flour, protein powder, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, and brown sugar.
2. Add the soya milk and lemon juice. Stir until smooth. The batter should be thick but pourable—if too thick, add a little more soya milk.
3. Heat a non-stick pan over low-medium heat and lightly grease it with coconut oil.
4. Spoon about 2 tbsp (30ml) of batter per pancake into the pan and gently spread it out.
5. Cook for about 2–3 minutes per side until golden brown.
6. Serve with toppings like banana slices, extra cinnamon, or a drizzle of melted dark chocolate!
