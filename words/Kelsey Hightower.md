Kelsey is a really "dope" (one of his trademark words) person who mainly does DevOps stuff. Kelsey comes from a humble background and has run the entire gamut from doing physical IT to leading Google's cloud strategy.

His demos and presentations are legendary as some of the best in the industry. He routinely leads keynotes with live demos.

A talk by Kelsey called [[Serializing your culture]], gave me the idea to track [[Zivver]] deployments as issues in our issue tracker

He's often an outspoken advocate for [[Terraform]] and other Hashicorp tools.

He created the [[NoCode]] movement

He wrote "Kubernetes the hard way", a book about building your own cluster from scratch. He often takes that approach, and when learning crypto he actually had written his own blockchain and smart contracts.

In Twitter, Kelsey is often praised as a very approachable mentor, who often jumps into calls to explain key concepts to strangers personally
