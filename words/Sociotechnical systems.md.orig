[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociotechnical_system) says:
>**Sociotechnical systems** (**STS**) in [organizational development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_development "Organizational development") is an approach to complex organizational [work design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_design "Work design") that recognizes the interaction between [people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People "People") and [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology") in [workplaces](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Workplace "wiktionary:Workplace"). The term also refers to coherent systems of human relations, technical objects, and [cybernetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics "Cybernetics") processes that inhere to large, complex infrastructures. Social society, and its constituent substructures, qualify as complex sociotechnical systems.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociotechnical_system#cite_note-1)

The theory is excellent, and it is interesting to me how concepts like "Sociotechnical design" have a rich history of research and discussion, yet the tech industry seems to rediscover them seemingly as a novel thing every few decades. I learned about it during one such cycle around 2020.

> Sociotechnical theory is founded on two main principles:
> 
>One is that the [interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_interaction "Social interaction") of social and technical factors creates the conditions for successful (or unsuccessful) organizational [performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance "Performance"). This interaction consists partly of [linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear "Linear") "cause and effect" relationships (the relationships that are normally "designed") and partly from "[non-linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-linear "Non-linear")", [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity "Complexity"), even unpredictable relationships (the good or bad relationships that are often unexpected). Whether designed or not, both types of interaction occur when socio and technical elements are put to work.
> 
>The corollary of this, and the second of the two main principles, is that optimization of each aspect alone (socio or technical) tends to increase not only the quantity of unpredictable, "un-designed" relationships, but those relationships that are injurious to the system's performance.
