I usually discourage people from getting me gifts. Minimizing consumption is one of [My values](alkoclick/words/My%20values.md), so people find it hard to pick out gifts that work. Here are some ideas.

## Books
While technically objects, once I'm done, I can drop these off in a local exchange library. I keep a list of [Books to read](Books%20to%20read.md)

## Experiences
* A trip to a nearby city
* Opera/Theatre tickets
