750G filo choriatiki
220G white cheese from jumbo
100G yellow cheese grated

Felt like there should be more cheese

Tried on [[2023-03-19]] with:

750G filo choriatiki
220G white cheese Jumbo
50G yellow cheese grated
200G white hard cheese Dodoni

Quantity was just right. Cheese mix was pretty salty though.

Jumbo white cheese feels like it melts too much. Perhaps I can find an alternative white cheese?

1 sheet of filo pita
~240G of yellow and cheddar cheese
Thyme

Watered the edges to seal properly
Oiled the top and added the sesame
