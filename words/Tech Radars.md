Tech Radars are nifty little things that people who usually call themselves Code Architects sometimes create. Now don't get me started on those people, but I definitely respect their work. Tech radars are maps of software where industry experts plot their (opinionated) views on what is good software to use and what is not. Some of the most popular ones are by [Zalando](https://opensource.zalando.com/tech-radar/) and [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar). It is good to drop by these from time to time - they can guide you on what people in the industry would like to be doing. Closer to the core is always better. Something being in the radar in a bad position (such as hold) is still better than not being on the radar.
