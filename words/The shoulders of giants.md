Hey cool kids!  

"Something something shoulders of giants, something"
- Someone famous

In tech, we have our own giants. [Sometimes they openly endorse pedophiles](https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20870050/richard-stallman-resigns-mit-free-software-foundation-epstein), sometimes they don't! Sadly, we've lost a few [incredible souls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) (yes, he created markdown too) already. But the world keeps going and I'd like to introduce you to 2 people who you may or may not know already, but the industry definitely does.

_(Hint: The links lead to interesting articles and you can click other places in the page and read more! It's called the internet)_

(2023 Alex editing): Yeah, the link to Bob Martin has been removed 

[Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/microservices/)

These people are not without their faults either (just try following Bob on twitter, ugh), but they have shaped in the industry in ways few others have. They were both in the original [agile 17](https://agilemanifesto.org/), they helped found concepts such as TDD, microservices and much much more, and both their blogs are incredible treasure troves of information for some of the most highly regarded concepts of our field. I cannot possibly stress how much more beneficial it would be to read Fowler for 2 hours, rather than attend a university lecture on software design for the same duration. Try it. Feel free to reach out for follow-up discussions!  

_Oh look, the US is about to sing us a song!_

What is privacy?

_What is that EU? What did you say? Come again please? G - D - P - what?_

Yeah, dunno about you, but I feel I've picked the right continent to live in.

In other news, [Mark's 'sky high' AWS bill](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/10/mark-zuckerberg-says-aws-bill-for-czi-is-sky-high.html) surely concerns all of us (I could barely sleep last night), but Mark himself is probably concerned about something else - [everybody left his party](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/11/20910330/mastercard-stripe-ebay-facebook-libra-association-withdrawal-cryptocurrency)

_Why is that relevant to us?_   

Well, Libra signifies the "big biz" version of cryptos, just like FB gave rise to the "big biz" version of social media. If that, in all its investor-backed majesty, cannot succeed, it means that crypto technologies will remain both more open and free (without corporations), but also way less funded. The field is interesting for PoC (Proof of Concept) stuff and [self-governed hacker spaces](https://aragon.org/project/governance/) but definitely not looking like a hugely promising dev work right now. But if you feel like changing the world then hot damn is this something to keep an eye on!

Let's not get technical this week. There should be enough theory in those two blogs to talk through all [Star Trek films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Trek_films_and_television_series#Feature_films). But please don't - nobody likes people who talk during a movie

_except the people who talk during a movie themselves_

That's all for now and hoping your tomorrow is as sunny as I feel right now!
  
Cheers,
Alexander P.
