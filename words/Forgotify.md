Service for listening to unlistened songs on Spotify. 

The concept of consuming art that others have not been exposed to is interesting, and I could even see it becoming somewhat meaningful - you are listening to an idea that noone else has listened to previously. Though, to be fair, in this example this is just about Spotify listens, but the concept can be grander than that.
