# Infrastructure as Code
Infrastructure as code is the premise of managing infrastructure in files, rather than a series of actions you take, e.g in the [[AWS]] console

It's often paired with Declarative Configuration  , Version Control Systems and Immutability to create infra that is reviewable, with changes that are predictable and revertable.
