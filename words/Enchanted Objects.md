"Enchanted" objects are objects which have some property besides their physical characteristics.

These objects all have in common the fact that there is something "special" about them. This specialness is both unique to the object and to the beholder. If we would put two lighters side by side, they wouldn't matter to most people, but if the left one was the lighter used by Pele, that would matter more or less to some people.

Here are some possible examples:
* Your wedding ring
* A childhood toy
* A lighter you carried with you during all of university

Most interestingly the same applies to things which are otherwise perceived as fungible - that is completely interchangeable. One such thing is money. Money is something we often treat as fungible and yet, Scrooge Mc Duck's most prized possession is one specific penny. In his case, the penny is important to him because it was the first money he ever received as his own.

## Enchanted Digital Objects

I don't know if we can have enchanted digital objects. The now classic essay [[The Colour of Bits]] touches upon a similar topic, which is that a specific arrangement of bits may be special based on where it came from. The author makes a very extended point on how computer scientists are trained not to see the "colour" (providence) of bits because computers can't perceive it, yet society values the understanding of that property.

What about your WoW character, a level 75 night elf with a collection of mighty items? Another user could build the same character and give them the same items, even join the same clans as you, yet if you sat at their computer you would inherently know that you are playing another character.

Just to address that: Yes, I'm aware of NFTs, but no, I don't think they bring anything to this discussion.

## When things are beings

On [[2023-03-04]] I visited the Stedejlik modern art museum in [[Amsterdam]] that had an exhibition titled: "When things are beings". Different artists were exploring the concept of objects and spaces which are more than mere objects. There is an interesting [related booklet](../media/when-things-are-beings.pdf) with the text of that exhibition (though sadly not too many pictures): 


## Enchanted religious objects

Religion and magick have a long history of both using enchanted objects and actively creating new ones. In fact, it's often central to the practice.

Let's look at two different approaches of enchanting objects in Orthodox Christianity, which I'm quite familiar with.

1. The bread and wine are converted to holy communion through a ritual. The bread and wine at the start of the ritual is normal, it could have been baked that very day. Through the process of saying some things and doing some movements in specific clothing, in a specific room within a temple, a priest of the religion enchants this bread. The enchanted bread has thus been converted to the offering.

2. The "Holy Light" is light which is supposed to come from a cave in Jerusalem where it burns forever. It is then transported to all churches in Greece and shared with people there during Easter night. In this case, it is the providence of the the light, where it came from, that matters to believers. They can then enchant their own objects, their candles, with that holy light, thus connecting to the chain of providence.

The google search for "Enchanted Objects" is polluted by some internet-of-things project some MIT guy did a few years ago. Yet I distinctly remember coming across this concept somewhere else in writing...

Naming things adds to enchanting them

## Open Questions

How would you enchant an object with "air"?
* Open holes in it and allow air to pass through them
* Allow air to shape it

Is there a limit to how many objects you can enchant?  Does scarcity affect the strength of the bond?

Is there a difference between saying this is "my personal" object and saying this object  is "enchanted with me"? Does that apply to all personal objects?
* Not much probably

How do you disenchant an object?
* Forgetting it
* this also means that you can make an enchantment stronger by making its memory stronger, e.g by writing down its story
