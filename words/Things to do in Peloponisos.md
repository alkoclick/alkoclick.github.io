# Things to do in Peloponisos
## Museums

#### Pylos
* Nestor's palace
* Niokastro + Archaeological Museum 

#### Ancient Olympia
* There's the entire area that's a walkable archaeological site
* There's an archaeological museum on location
* There's also a [tourist trappy place](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Padelina+Shopping+Center/@37.6578876,21.6291662,13.35z/data=!4m7!3m6!1s0x13609302a1c1e39f:0x7c1e2389def98c6d!8m2!3d37.6545486!4d21.6251525!9m1!1b1) that offers olive oil and balsamic tastings?

#### Mycenae
* One of the origins of ancient greek civilization and birthplace of a bunch of mythical heroes

#### Nemea
* There's an absolutely gorgeous archaeological site (they used to have games like the Olympics!), that's also not very busy

## Landscapes

#### Navarino Bay
* Kind of taken over by a fancy golf club and retreat thing

#### Loutraki
* Great food, great views. Can get super busy at times

#### Kalamaris Waterfall
* 10 minute walk leading up to it from Gialova

#### Cape Tainaro
* The southernmost part of the peninsula, necromancer temple

#### Monemvasia
* Once-in-a-lifetime location, well worth a daily trip

#### Nafplio
* OG capital of Greece, beautiful city, not super crowded usually (for Greek standards)

#### Gerolimenas
* Tiny old fisherman's port, featured among other things, in the opening chapter of a Jules Verne story


## Food
Pretty much every single tavern in Greece is legit, but these are places that I have personally tried and can strongly recommend

#### Skarpeta - Nafplio

#### Ippokampos - Assos
* This is a location where we used to go as children more than 20 years ago and is still operating


## Swimming
I don't have the strongest opinion on the topic, as all beaches in the area are super good already.


## Activities

#### Bungee jumping on the Corinth Canal

#### Epidayrus theatre
* One of the most ancient theaters still in operation, has plays with greek and english supertitles

#### Olive oil and honey tasting/teaching sessions
