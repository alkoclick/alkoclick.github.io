I got this keyboard after being in my [ZSA Moonlander](ZSA%20Moonlander.md) for a bit because I wanted something lighter and smaller for travels that I could also use wirelessly. While I didn't know the brand previously, I was positively surprised with the customization and result!

This is how it looks like, surrounded by the mighty Moonlander:

I did do a minor fuckup: While setting up my piantor pro keyboard I kinda trolled by removing the key for the number layer right before I went out, which was a real doozy because that layer has the studio unlock key. As a result, I had to reflash the reset settings firmware on both halves, then a fresh default config.
