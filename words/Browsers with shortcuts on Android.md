I have a simple request: I want keyboard shortcuts working on my Android browser. That's it. 


* Firefox on Android doesn't do it
* Vivaldi used to work but Ctrl+W is broken since 7.8 and also typing fast in the address bar somehow erases what you've already written
* DuckDuckGo doesn't do it
* Brave kind does it, but like Vivaldi the close tab shortcut is broken recently, seems to be this bug in Chromium: https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/51294
* Samsung internet (yeah I was desperate) supports shortcuts but when you open a new tab it doesn't select the URL for some reason?
* Opera (with its absolutely dogshit privacy policy, that also lies to you and says it's a "Standard European company consent screen" so they can sell all your data) also doesn't select the URL (like Samsung Internet)
