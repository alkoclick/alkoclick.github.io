> Write with the door closed, rewrite with the door open. Your stuff starts out being just for you, in other words, but then it goes out. Once you know what the story is and get it right — as right as you can, anyway — it belongs to anyone who wants to read it. Or criticize it.

This was more or less what my authoring process had turned out to be, but maybe it's best to write it down here, for more clarity.

1. Writing with the door closed
This is the stage where I just write stuff down on (digital) paper. It's focused on just capturing an idea so it doesn't get lost. 

2. Writing with the door open
After some potential light cleanup, stuff can go to the public section of my knowledge base, which ends up in the [Blog](../Blog.md). I can and do share it from there, and reach out to folks to ask for their input. This is now a public idea, but not necessarily one I share widely yet.

3. Publishing
This is the stage where after incorporating the feedback from folks, I feel comfortable calling something done. In some cases I share this to my social network. In some cases I publish across sites, for example in the past I used Medium for this.
