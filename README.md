Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Summary
I'm Alexandros Papageorgiou Koufidis, a DevOps-focused software developer from Greece, currently living in Amsterdam. 
Besides creating good software, I believe in diversity of thoughts, bodies and minds, as an inclusive way to address the inequalities we face today and may face tomorrow.

## Quick bio
At 18, I started working various entry-level jobs. At 21, and while interning as a SysAdmin for my university I developed an app for hobby games sellers to automatically price their products based on various algorithms and strategies. 
Next year I dropped out of university and moved to Poland for romance, while working remotely at a VR game development startup. 
After going back in Greece, I started a hobby games web store with a friend, then moved to Switzerland when I started working for CERN. 
On the same year, 2019 I also cofounded Thalatta, a software development startup. 
After CERN, I pivoted to DevOps and worked at Zivver, a secure communications company in Amsterdam, then VanMoof, a high-tech ebike scaleup.
I'm currently working as an SRE at Miro, a visual collaboration editor.
