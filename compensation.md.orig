This is my list of tech-related compensations.
I am posting this publicly because I feel it helps folks to understand their options in the industry more, and hopefully also to increase the publicly available datapoints.

The inspiration came from [Xe's blog](https://xeiaso.net/salary-transparency).
Why don't you try it too?

All amounts are yearly.
