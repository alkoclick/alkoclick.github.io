## Salary Transparency

This is my list of tech-related compensations.
I am posting this publicly because I feel it helps folks to understand their options in the industry more, 
and hopefully also to increase the publicly available datapoints.

The inspiration came from [XE's blog](https://xeiaso.net/salary-transparency).
Why don't you try it too?

All amounts are yearly.
